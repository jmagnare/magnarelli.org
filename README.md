==============

This is my website - I created it largely for personal satisfaction, but it's also a showcase of some of my professional and personal work. It uses the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) UI framework to get things done and help with responsiveness. It works on Chrome, Firefox, IE >= 9, and many mobile browsers. It is available in two flavors: [classic](http://www.magnarelli.org) and [sexy](http://www.magnarelli.sexy).

The re-written version (live as of early April, 2014) is my first practical application of the css I've been learning in Adam Schwartz's [Magic of CSS](http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css) course, which I highly recommend checking out.

As always, please reach out if you have any questions.
